** DONE Update temporary highlight function to be less convoluted
   CLOSED: [2020-02-12 Wed 13:53]
** DONE Rebuild parse tree on changes
   CLOSED: [2020-02-14 Fri 12:59]
*** use after-change-functions to track changed location              :elisp:
*** use idle timer to queue update                                    :elisp:
*** setup function to rebuild region of parse tree                    :ocaml:
**** split list into three - before, in and after region
**** parse edited region and replace in section
**** otherwise, parse from start to eof and replace in and after
**** otherwise, reparse file
**** DONE otherwise drop changes
