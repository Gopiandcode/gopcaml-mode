* Inessential todos
** TODO - move zipper to point and kill
*** DONE C-M-k - kill sexp
    CLOSED: [2020-02-19 Wed 17:17]
*** TODO C-M-spc - mark sexp - move zipper to point and select region
** TODO M-{, M-} - move paragraph - (i.e top level structure items)
** TODO M-a, M-e - move sentences - module
** TODO M-k - kill sentence - kill module
** TODO C-M-l reposition to buffer - fix to work with ocaml
* Longer term Todos
** TODO move to (??) type holes with C-n C-p if present in function DWIM
*** Write function to check if current buffer contains any type holes
*** Write function to return position of next type hole
** TODO add expression and more functionality to zipper
** TODO integrate with merlin (d)estruct/(l)ocate
** TODO Extract binding
** TODO Highlight regions
*** Add function to find all repetitions of enclosing expression
*** add function to highlight all these bounds temporarily
*** add-on-idle function to run highlight on delay
* Gopcaml-mode Ideas
** Better move to defun recognition
*** If point on the same line, then use current item
*** Use line distance rather than character distance  (makes more sense)
*** In case of tie then use column
